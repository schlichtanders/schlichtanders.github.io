To get familiarized with Angular, I wrote an app that plots extents of all reported observations of invasive fish in Canada.  Uses data from <a href="http://geoportal-geoportail.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services/Reported_Observations_Aquatic_Invasive_Species_ENG/MapServer" target="_blank">here</a> and queries Wikipedia for an extract if it exists.
