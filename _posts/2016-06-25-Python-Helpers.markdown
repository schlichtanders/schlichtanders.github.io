This module is a collection of helper functionalities which appeared to be useful here and there when working with Python.

I can especially recommend ``myfunctools`` which gathers really useful higher order functions, importantly ``myfunctools.fmap``, ``myfunctools.compose`` and others. Also, take a look at ``myobjects``, especially ``myobjects.Structure``.
