description: First trial to build my own robot.
---

After a robot internship at University of Osnabr√ºck a good friend of mine
and I were motivated to build our own robot.

A Raspberry Pi was the favourite choice for controlling the system, as we
wanted to use full-fleshed ROS in the end, the major Robot Operating System.
So no Arduino.

It took a while to setup everything, but it runs and is controllable with
the keyboard. OK, that is not really that impressive, but for us it was a big
success already.

##### Extra Features

Bi-okular vision was implemented, and also a 3D sensor, an ASUS Xtion, was bought.
For mobile computation power, I configured my Nexus 4 to run Ubuntu and ROS,
which indeed worked out. Of course, ROS also runs on the laptop's Ubuntu,
but it is great to know that in principle smart phones may be enough.

##### To Be Continued
For my Masters I changed the town and so this project went to sleep a bit earlier
than expected.
