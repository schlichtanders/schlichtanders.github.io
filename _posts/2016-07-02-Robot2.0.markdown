description: Building an advanced automatic robot.

Since a while I am planning to build a second, more professional robot with
additional skills. Everything is collected up to know

But configuring everything in hardware and software still needs time.
This summer it should happen!

##### The Idea
The idea is really good. It should be a combination of a base robot, going on wheels,
and a quadrocopter with gripper, realizing the arm of the robot. While the base
robot already has a ASUS Xtion 3D sensor, as well as an IMU and a bi-okular cameram,
the flying arm at most gets a simple camera sensor for tracking objects during flight.

The main tracking is supposed to happen by the 3D sensor, which is complemented by
stationary Microsoft Kinect 2 for higher resolution.

The whole setting is of course meant as an indoor research project (the 3D sensors
do not work that well in the wild).

##### Impressions
This is the quadrocopter used:

and this the Wild Thumper 4WD, the basics of the base:
