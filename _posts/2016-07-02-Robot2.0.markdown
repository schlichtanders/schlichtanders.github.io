description: Building an advanced automatic robot.

Since a while I am planning to build a second, more professional robot with
additional skills. Everything is collected up to know

<img src="{{ "/img/portfolio/second_robot.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-responsive" alt="">

But configuring everything in hardware and software still needs time.

##### The Idea
This robot is meant to be a combination of a base robot, going on wheels,
and a quadrocopter with gripper (mechanical/magnetic), realizing the arm of the robot. While the base
robot already has an ASUS Xtion 3D sensor, as well as an IMU and a binocular camera system,
the flying arm gets at most a simple camera sensor for tracking objects during flight.

The main tracking is supposed to happen by the 3D sensor, which is complemented by a
stationary Microsoft Kinect 2 for higher resolution.

The whole setting is of course meant as an indoor research project (the 3D sensors
do not work that well in the wild). The first big aim is to transport forks and other little things
within a fixed apartment, combining the flying quadrocopter (with magnetic gripper)
and the driving base.

##### Impressions
Quadrocopter, Wild Thumper 4WD (with gripper, which is going to be part of the quadrocopter), and an electro permanent magnet (gripper alternative for quadrocopter).
